# #FrontEndSessions README.md

How many times have you looked for an npm plugn and found out that the developer has left the workings of the plugin as a not-so-fun little puzzle that you have to work out?
I wanted to talk about something I think is so important and would benefit junior developers in their careers. So let's talk about...

# README.MD!

![](https://miro.medium.com/max/4096/0*QYZSlY60oEeKQJdN.)

In my early days as a developer, **I really underestimated how important these were**. I would just literally jump straight into the coding part and finish with the coding part. I never really cared too much about documenting the process until becoming a professional developer, where we develop software as a team rather than as a lone wolf. If you know anything about tech, then you should know that documentation is something nobody can be too good at.

**READMEs are super important** to you, other people who will read your code and last but not least, **future employers. **After you guys get to grips with coding, the coaches and the careers team will start telling you about the other important stuff to the people who will be hiring you and your **project READMEs will be something that will be mentioned a lot**.

# READMEs are the a book-covers and blurbs to your code.

There have been many times where I have been looking at stuff on GitHub and saw no readme and **it didnâ€™t leave me with good thoughts about the project**. _Sometimes I even skipped using plugins & gems because I looked up the GitHub pages and there was no README_ on the page. No instructions, no use-cases, no possible issues. It projects an image of something that is kind of unmaintained and unprofessional. **Everything we want to avoid as professional developers!**

5 Things you should have on your READMEâ€™s

# **Project Overviews**

This should include what your project is and why you created it. It illustrates your thought process and highlights the reason you have made this piece of software or code.

# **Installation / Instructions**

This should illustrate preferably step by step how to install or boot up what you have created. **If you could include images that would make your projects readmeâ€™s look incredible.** Do the same for the instructions and possibly include code examples for a really great readme that leaves no holes.

# **Technologies Used**

The perfect opportunity to list all the obscure plugins, gems, NPMs or frameworks you have used to create your software/project.

# **Testing**

Remember to describe what testing framework you have used and also quick instructions of how to run the tests

# **Contributing Members**

Give credit where its due! This would be the place to have links to any contributorâ€™s GitHub / website etc. etc.

This list can be exhaustive but it makes sense to have at least these 5 things in a readme. When you get into these habits early by the time you are in my position, **you will have an incredible looking GitHub with fully documented projects and it will look SO impressive to potential recruiters, and the Makers Careers team**. It shows that you are a considerable developer, who always thinks about how others can easily use and contribute to the codebase. A very attractive trait (to employers ðŸ˜…)

Thanks for reading & good luck on your first weekend challenge, let me know how it goes and for any help if needed!

Have a great weekend!
